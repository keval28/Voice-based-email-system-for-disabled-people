# Voice-based-email-system-for-disabled-people

One of the most used forms of communication among people is Email. A lot of confidential and
urgent information is exchanged over emails in todayâ€™s time. There are about 500 million
disabled people worldwide. These disabled people are facing a problem of communication. Since
technology is growing day by day, these disabled people feel that they are more challenged. So, 
we proposed a Voice-based Email System that will make the email system very easily accessible
to disabled people and help society. 

This system will be a python-based application for disabledpersons using speech to text voice, 
thus enabling everyone to control their E-mail accounts usingtheir voice only and to be able to 
read, send, and perform the other useful tasks. This emailsystem is utilized by a disabled people 
to access their mail easily by allowing the users to command and control the system through their 
voice. The system will give the user a voice command to perform a certain action and the user will 
respond to the same. Accessibility is the most important feature that is considered while developing 
this system. The users ought to use certain keywords which can perform certain actions like Read, 
Send, Compose Mail, etc. Voice Based email system helps disabled people to access e-mail. All functions 
to be utilized in this technique are supposed to be easy mouse click operations creating the system very
user friendly.
